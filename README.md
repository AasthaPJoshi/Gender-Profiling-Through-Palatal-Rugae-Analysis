# Gender-Profiling-Through-Palatal-Rugae-Analysis

## Overview:
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to analyze palatal rugae patterns for gender profiling. Palatal rugae, the unique ridges on the roof of the mouth, serve as distinctive biometric features that remain stable throughout an individual's life. The aim was to enhance forensic identification by leveraging these patterns for gender determination, providing a non-invasive and efficient tool for forensic and medical applications.

# Technologies Used:
## Deep Learning Frameworks:
TensorFlow: For designing and training the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture.
PyTorch: For advanced model experimentation and tuning.

# Model Architectures:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Used for feature extraction and image classification.
Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNNs): Applied to identify specific regions of interest within the palatal rugae for precise gender profiling.

## Programming Language:
Python: For implementing the deep learning algorithms and preprocessing steps.

## Image Processing Tools:
Libraries like OpenCV were utilized for initial image enhancement, segmentation, and noise reduction.

## Data Annotation Tools:
Used for marking the palatal rugae regions in the dataset images for supervised learning.

## Dataset Management:
Data augmentation techniques were applied to increase the diversity of training data, including rotation, scaling, and flipping.
Training and validation datasets were created for robust model evaluation.

## Metrics
Accuracy: 90% for CNN-based models, 78% for RCNN-based models.
Precision, recall, and F1 score were used to ensure the modelâ€™s reliability.

## Key Contributions:

## Feature Extraction:
